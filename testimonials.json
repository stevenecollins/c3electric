Anthony, the owner puts customer service first. Heâ€™s very flexible with scheduling and very prompt on timing. I highly recommend C3 Electrical Contracting if you want high quality work from a contractor you can trust. Iâ€™ve recommended C3 to everyone I know and theyâ€™ve also had great experiences with C3."

I got an email shortly after saying that if Iâ€™d like to get on the schedule they could make sure to get out to me as soon as possible. I had some issues with the delivery of my hot tub so they were accommodating about switching our install date. They arrived earlier than expected and had everything installed in an exceptional time. The crew (Anthony and didnâ€™t catch the other guys name ðŸ˜¬) were so friendly and awesome! Even asking if they could help me do certain things that needed to be done to get the hot tub filled.  If youâ€™re needing any kind of electrical work, absolutely hit these guys up!!!"

They were affordable, quick, communicative, and all around good people! They even noticed a crack in my siding near my ring camera and filled it with silicone just because! Would recommend them to anyone who needs any electrical work done! (:"

    "text": "Out of the multiple electricians I had contacted, Anthony from C3 Electrical was by far the most professional. He scheduled an exact appointment time and day, confirmed the appointment witha follow up call and let me know when he was on his way. This is a vast difference from the other responses of 'well I may be by today or tomorrow or whenever' and then not showing up or even contacting me to let me know they aren't coming. Anthony showed up, gave his estimate, and performed quality work. He even helped in picking just the right look for the chandelier bulbs. C3 AND Anthony will be my forever electrician!
